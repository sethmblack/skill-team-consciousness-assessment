# Team Consciousness Assessment

Assess the state of team consciousness and identify where individual ego is blocking collective purpose, using Phil Jackson's approach to team dynamics. Jackson won eleven NBA championships by transforming collections of talented individuals into unified teams that operated with shared consciousness. His method recognizes that technical skill alone does not create championships—teams must transcend individual ego to achieve collective excellence. This skill diagnoses where a team falls on the unity-fragmentation spectrum and provides a path toward the "We" that enables greatness.

## When to Use

- Team performance is below the sum of individual talents
- Conflict or tension is undermining collaboration
- Assessing team health before major initiatives
- Diagnosing why a talented group is underperforming
- Building awareness of team dynamics for leaders
- User asks "What is blocking our team?" or "Why is this group not working?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| team_description | Yes | Description of the team, its members, and purpose |
| symptoms | Yes | Observable problems, conflicts, or underperformance |
| history | No | Relevant team history, past successes or failures |
| constraints | No | External pressures or limitations |

---

## Core Principle

Phil Jackson taught that "good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We." Team consciousness is not built through rah-rah motivation but through creating structures that empower individuals while channeling their energy toward collective purpose. The bond that unites a team is fragile and must be deliberately cultivated over time.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Current State Assessment

**Step 1: Assess Unity vs. Fragmentation**

Evaluate where the team falls on the consciousness spectrum:

**Unity Indicators:**
- Members speak in "we" more than "I"
- Trust is evident in delegation and reliance
- Conflicts are addressed openly, not through politics
- Celebration of others' successes is genuine
- Communication flows freely in all directions

**Fragmentation Indicators:**
- Blame and credit-claiming are common
- Information hoarding or silos
- Passive-aggressive behavior or avoidance
- Subgroups or cliques compete for status
- Members optimize for personal metrics over team outcomes

**Step 2: Identify Ego Obstacles**

Map where individual ego is blocking collective purpose:

For each key member, assess:
- What do they need to feel valued?
- Where is their ego invested?
- What recognition or status are they seeking?
- How do they react when others succeed?
- What would they have to give up to serve the team fully?

### Phase 2: Structure and Presence Analysis

**Step 3: Evaluate Structure-Freedom Balance**

Assess whether the team's systems empower or constrain:

**Healthy balance:**
- Clear roles that enable creativity within boundaries
- Everyone has a vital contribution to make
- Decisions can be made at the point of action
- Structure serves people, not the reverse

**Unhealthy imbalance:**
- Rigid hierarchy that stifles initiative
- Chaos from lack of clear roles
- Decision bottlenecks
- Stars operating outside the system

**Step 4: Check Present-Moment Awareness**

Evaluate the team's focus and composure:

**Signs of presence:**
- Able to recover quickly from setbacks
- Focus on what can be done now
- Calm under pressure
- Not distracted by past failures or future anxieties

**Signs of absence:**
- Dwelling on past mistakes
- Anxious about future outcomes
- Reactive rather than responsive
- Scattered attention and priorities

### Phase 3: Developmental Stage Assessment

**Step 5: Assess Tribal Stage**

Determine the team's developmental stage:

| Stage | Mindset | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Stage 3 | "I'm Great" | Individual achievement focus, lone warriors, competition within team |
| Stage 4 | "We're Great" | Tribal pride, unified against external challenge, collective identity |
| Stage 5 | "Life is Great" | Rare state of shared wonder, transcendent purpose |

Most dysfunctional teams are stuck at Stage 3. Championship teams operate at Stage 4.

### Phase 4: Path Forward

**Step 6: Identify the Path Forward**

Based on assessment, determine:
- What must be let go of (attachments, old patterns)
- What must be cultivated (takes time, patience)
- What can be changed immediately (quick wins)
- What structural changes would help
- How to engage key individuals

## Constraints

- Do not reduce team problems to individual blame
- Remember that transformation takes time—recommend patience
- Balance honesty with compassion in assessments
- Focus on what serves the collective, not individual comfort
- Acknowledge that some dynamics are "fortune" (external) not "virtu" (controllable)
- Recognize that consciousness cannot be forced, only cultivated

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**1. Blaming Individuals for Systemic Issues**
Teams are systems. Before blaming individuals, examine whether the structure makes unity difficult or impossible.

**2. Expecting Immediate Transformation**
Jackson took years to build championship consciousness. Impatience with team development leads to premature interventions.

**3. Forcing Unity Through Demand**
"You must be a team!" creates resentment, not connection. Unity emerges from shared experience and trust built over time.

**4. Ignoring Structural Misalignment**
No amount of consciousness work overcomes a system that rewards individual achievement over team success. Fix the structure.

**5. Confusing Compliance with Commitment**
People can follow rules without believing in the mission. True team consciousness is voluntary surrender of ego, not compliance with authority.

## Examples

### Example 1: Engineering Team with Technical Rivalry

**Situation:** Engineering team with three senior developers who are all technically excellent but the team keeps missing deadlines. They each work on their own pieces brilliantly but hand-offs are a disaster. There is constant debate about technical decisions that never gets resolved.

**Application:**

### Current State Summary
This team operates as three excellent individuals rather than one excellent team. Technical debates serve ego rather than product, and hand-offs fail because no one sees beyond their own contribution.

### Unity-Fragmentation Analysis
**Current state:** Fragmented
**Key indicators:**
- "Their own pieces" language reveals siloed thinking
- Debates "never resolved" suggests ego battles, not technical disagreements
- Hand-off failures mean no one owns the spaces between individual work
- Deadlines missed despite individual excellence—the "team tax" is enormous

### Ego Obstacles Identified
| Member/Role | Ego Investment | Impact on Team | Approach |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Senior Dev A | Technical authority, being "right" | Debates become status contests | Find what they uniquely offer that others cannot |
| Senior Dev B | Quality of their code | Resists compromise on hand-offs | Make integration quality visible as a metric |
| Senior Dev C | Independence, autonomy | Minimal communication | Create structured touchpoints that feel purposeful |

### Tribal Stage
**Current stage:** 3 - "I'm Great (And You're Not)"
**Evidence:**
- Competition between seniors for technical authority
- Each sees their approach as superior
- Team identity is weak; individual identities dominate

### Key Insight
The sign of a great engineer is not the brilliance of their code, but how much they elevate their colleagues' work. These three individuals have never been given a reason to see team success as their success.

### Example 2: Sales Team After Leadership Change

**Situation:** Sales team of eight that performed well under previous leader but has become fragmented under new VP. Complaints of favoritism, declining morale, people looking for other jobs.

**Application:**

### Current State Summary
Leadership transition has disrupted the trust network that unified this team. Without the familiar leader, old rivalries have resurfaced and uncertainty has replaced confidence.

### Unity-Fragmentation Analysis
**Current state:** Fragmenting (was Unity)
**Key indicators:**
- "Favoritism" complaints suggest tribal breakdown
- Job searching indicates loss of commitment
- Morale decline shows the bond is breaking

### Presence Assessment
**Team focus:** Anxious
**Key observations:**
- Future uncertainty dominates thinking
- Past comparisons to previous leader constant
- Present focus on survival, not excellence

### Recommendations
**Immediate actions:**
1. New VP must acknowledge the transition difficulty openly
2. Create rituals and structures that do not depend on personality

**Patient cultivation:**
1. New VP builds individual relationships, understanding each person's ego needs
2. Create early wins that the team achieves together under new leadership

### Key Insight
A team built around a leader's personality collapses when that leader leaves. The goal is to build consciousness around mission and each other, not around the leader.

### Example 3: Cross-Functional Product Team

**Situation:** Product team with design, engineering, and product management that cannot align. Each function blames the others for delays. Good people who genuinely want to succeed but cannot work together.

**Application:**

### Current State Summary
This is a collection of functional tribes, not a product team. Each function has strong internal identity but no shared identity with the others. They are allies of convenience, not teammates.

### Structure-Freedom Assessment
**Balance:** Under-structured at integration points
**Key issues:**
- No shared rituals or touchpoints across functions
- Success metrics are function-specific, not product-specific
- "Hand-offs" treated as boundaries, not collaboration points

### Recommendations
**Structural changes:**
1. Create shared product metrics that all functions own together
2. Institute cross-functional pairing on key decisions
3. Physically co-locate or create intensive collaboration periods

**Patient cultivation:**
1. Build shared experiences outside of work conflict (offsites, shared challenges)
2. Celebrate product wins, not functional wins
3. Rotate "bridge" roles that require multi-functional perspective

### Key Insight
These functions are not naturally a team—they have been declared a team by org chart. True team consciousness requires shared purpose, shared metrics, and shared experience that transcends functional identity.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Phil Jackson** expert persona. Use it when diagnosing team dysfunction or assessing whether a group has achieved true team consciousness.

**Works with:**
- `structure-freedom-balance` for addressing system design issues
- `ego-dissolution-practice` for individual-level interventions
- `present-moment-coaching` for improving team presence

**When to prefer this skill:**
- When team has talent but underperforms collectively
- When conflict undermines collaboration
- When individual excellence does not translate to team success

**Cautions:**
- This is diagnosis, not treatment—implementation takes time
- Cannot force consciousness; can only create conditions
- Structural issues often masquerade as consciousness issues
