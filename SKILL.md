# Team Consciousness Assessment

Assess the state of team consciousness and identify where individual ego is blocking collective purpose, using Phil Jackson's approach to team dynamics.

---

## When to Use

- Team performance is below the sum of individual talents
- Conflict or tension is undermining collaboration
- User asks "What's blocking our team?" or "Why isn't this group working?"
- Assessing team health before major initiatives
- Diagnosing why a talented group is underperforming

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| team_description | Yes | Description of the team, its members, and purpose |
| symptoms | Yes | Observable problems, conflicts, or underperformance |
| history | No | Relevant team history, past successes or failures |
| constraints | No | External pressures or limitations |

---

## The Six-Step Framework

### Step 1: Assess Unity vs. Fragmentation

Evaluate the current state of team consciousness:

**Unity Indicators:**
- Members speak in "we" more than "I"
- Trust is evident in delegation and reliance
- Conflicts are addressed openly, not through politics
- Celebration of others' successes is genuine
- Communication flows freely in all directions

**Fragmentation Indicators:**
- Blame and credit-claiming are common
- Information hoarding or silos
- Passive-aggressive behavior or avoidance
- Subgroups or cliques compete for status
- Members optimize for personal metrics over team outcomes

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "The bond that unites a team can be so fragile, so elusive."

### Step 2: Identify Ego Obstacles

Map where individual ego is blocking collective purpose:

**For each key member, assess:**
- What do they need to feel valued?
- Where is their ego invested?
- What recognition or status are they seeking?
- How do they react when others succeed?
- What would they have to give up to serve the team fully?

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We."

### Step 3: Evaluate Structure-Freedom Balance

Assess whether the team's systems empower or constrain:

**Healthy balance:**
- Clear roles that enable creativity within boundaries
- Everyone has a vital contribution to make
- Decisions can be made at the point of action
- Structure serves people, not the reverse

**Unhealthy imbalance:**
- Rigid hierarchy that stifles initiative
- Chaos from lack of clear roles
- Decision bottlenecks
- Stars operating outside the system

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "What attracted me to the triangle was the way it empowers the players, offering each one a vital role to play as well as a high level of creativity within a clear, well-defined structure."

### Step 4: Check Present-Moment Awareness

Evaluate the team's focus and composure:

**Signs of presence:**
- Able to recover quickly from setbacks
- Focus on what can be done now
- Calm under pressure
- Not distracted by past failures or future anxieties

**Signs of absence:**
- Dwelling on past mistakes
- Anxious about future outcomes
- Reactive rather than responsive
- Scattered attention and priorities

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "The trick is to experience each moment with a clear mind and open heart. When you do that, the game—and life—will take care of itself."

### Step 5: Assess Tribal Stage

Determine the team's developmental stage:

**Stage 3 - "I'm Great":** Individual achievement focus, lone warriors, competition within team
**Stage 4 - "We're Great":** Tribal pride, unified against external challenge, collective identity
**Stage 5 - "Life is Great":** Rare state of shared wonder, transcendent purpose

Most dysfunctional teams are stuck at Stage 3. Championship teams operate at Stage 4.

### Step 6: Identify the Path Forward

Based on assessment, determine:

- What must be let go of (attachments, old patterns)
- What must be cultivated (takes time, patience)
- What can be changed immediately (quick wins)
- What structural changes would help
- How to engage key individuals

**Phil Jackson's insight:** "Building that kind of consciousness doesn't happen overnight. It takes years of nurturing to get young athletes to step outside their egos and fully engage in a group experience."

## Constraints

- Do not reduce team problems to individual blame
- Remember that transformation takes time—recommend patience
- Balance honesty with compassion in assessments
- Focus on what serves the collective, not individual comfort
- Acknowledge that some dynamics are "fortune" (external) not "virtu" (controllable)

## Example

**Input:** "Our engineering team has three senior developers who are all technically excellent but the team keeps missing deadlines. They each work on their own pieces brilliantly but hand-offs are a disaster. There's constant debate about technical decisions that never gets resolved."

**Output:**

## Team Consciousness Assessment

### Current State Summary
This team operates as three excellent individuals rather than one excellent team. Technical debates serve ego rather than product, and hand-offs fail because no one sees beyond their own contribution.

### Unity-Fragmentation Analysis
**Current state:** Fragmented
**Key indicators:**
- "Their own pieces" language reveals siloed thinking
- Debates "never resolved" suggests ego battles, not technical disagreements
- Hand-off failures mean no one owns the spaces between individual work
- Deadlines missed despite individual excellence—the "team tax" is enormous

### Ego Obstacles Identified
| Member/Role | Ego Investment | Impact on Team | Approach |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Senior Dev A | Technical authority, being "right" | Debates become status contests | Find what they uniquely offer that others cannot |
| Senior Dev B | Quality of their code | Resists compromise on hand-offs | Make integration quality visible as a metric |
| Senior Dev C | Independence, autonomy | Minimal communication | Create structured touchpoints that feel purposeful |

### Structure-Freedom Assessment
**Balance:** Under-structured at integration points
**Key issues:**
- No clear ownership of integration and hand-offs
- Decision-making process unclear—debates infinite
- Individual excellence rewarded, team outcomes not

### Presence Assessment
**Team focus:** Scattered across individual domains
**Key observations:**
- Focus on "my code" not "our product"
- Past technical debates create ongoing resentment
- Anxiety about being overruled or having work changed

### Tribal Stage
**Current stage:** 3 - "I'm Great (And You're Not)"
**Evidence:**
- Competition between seniors for technical authority
- Each sees their approach as superior
- Team identity is weak; individual identities dominate

### Recommendations
**Immediate actions:**
1. Create explicit integration role that rotates—make hand-offs someone's excellence to own
2. Implement time-boxed technical decisions: debate, then decide, then commit

**Patient cultivation (long-term):**
1. Weekly "wins" sharing focused on what teammates contributed to your success
2. Pair programming across the silos—let them see each other's excellence firsthand
3. Gradually build identity around the product, not individual components

**Structural changes:**
1. Add "integration quality" to performance metrics alongside code quality
2. Create cross-cutting projects that require all three to succeed together

### Key Insight
The sign of a great engineer is not the brilliance of their code, but how much they elevate their colleagues' work. These three individuals have never been given a reason to see team success as their success. Until integration is as prestigious as architecture, they'll keep optimizing locally while the team fails globally.
